    movl source, destination - moves a 32-bit value from the source to the destination
    addl source, destination - adds the source to the destination and stores the result in the destination
    subl source, destination - subtracts the source from the destination and stores the result in the destination
    andl source, destination - performs a bitwise AND operation on the source and destination and stores the result in the destination
    xorl source, destination - performs a bitwise XOR operation on the source and destination and stores the result in the destination
    shll source, destination - shifts the bits in the destination to the left by the number of bits specified in the source
    shr source, destination - shifts the bits in the destination to the right by the number of bits specified in the source
    jmp label - unconditionally jumps to the label
    jz label - jumps to the label if the zero flag is set
    jnz label - jumps to the label if the zero flag is not set
    jl label - jumps to the label if the less-than flag is set
    jle label - jumps to the label if the less-than or equal-to flag is set
    jg label - jumps to the label if the greater-than flag is set
    jge label - jumps to the label if the greater-than or equal-to flag is set
